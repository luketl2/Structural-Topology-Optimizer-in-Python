# Structural Topology Optimizer in Python

The Structural Topology Optimizer in Python is a tool using topology optimization to generate mechanical designs for specific loading scenarios. Given a domain shape, material properties, external loads, and boundary conditions, the app will graphically display a 2D design optimized for a defined objective function (stiffness or compliance in a given direction) and subject to defined volume constraints (as a percentage of overall domain volume).
